*This is firmware for the revised, rebooted version of the ChameleonMini RevE Rebooted which so many of you bought.
The chinese manufacturer had its firmware changes to themself which was limiting for all who bought this device.
After talks with manufacturer, they also came to the conclusion that it should be open-sourced.  I managed to get source from them and agreed to make a public repository on GitHub.
Since this firmware isn't in the official ChameleonMini repo,  I decided to make a 'iceman fork' of it.*

## Notice
Let us make this fork awesome to play with. Do please play with it. Get excited and experiment with your enhanced ChameleonMini device!

## Supported Cards and Codecs

## GUI
Based on the partial source code release for the GUI, we created a new GUI: [iceman's ChameleonMini rebootedGUI](https://github.com/iceman1001/ChameleonMini-rebootedGUI)
It is a windows .net based software and it is really nice to work with.
Has support for ChameleonMini revE / revG commands, dump management, color templates for dumps, and multilanguage.
